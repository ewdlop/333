# 333

I joked about this using

```typescript
type AngleRaymond = {
  name: string;
  goodDeeds: number;
};

type EvilRaymond = {
  name: string;
  evilPlans: number;
};

type Raymond = AngleRaymond | EvilRaymond;(I didn't tag)
```
Now I get to speak using the following

Id says:
Ego says:
Superego says;
We says:
(Does I ever even exist at first place?)

type I = Id or Ego or Superego = Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
